#  OpenAFS Client Manager — GNOME Shell Extension

> **GSoC 2025 Project** under the [OpenAFS](https://www.openafs.org/) organization

## 📌 Overview

This GNOME Shell extension aims to provide a **graphical interface** for managing the **OpenAFS** client on Linux desktops. OpenAFS is a powerful distributed file system widely adopted in academic and research settings, but its reliance on CLI tools can make it less approachable for everyday users.

This extension simplifies and enhances user interaction with OpenAFS by integrating a GUI directly into the GNOME Shell top bar.

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Start/Stop the OpenAFS client via systemd
- ✅ Acquire/manage Kerberos authentication tokens
- ✅ View token expiration and cell connectivity status
- 🛎️ (Stretch) Notifications for token expiry
- 🔁 (Stretch) Shortcuts to switch AFS cells

---

## 🔧 Technical Stack

- **GJS (GNOME JavaScript)** for writing the extension logic
- **GNOME Shell APIs** for UI and system integration
- **GLib.spawn_command_line_async** for commands like:
  - `systemctl start openafs-client`
  - `aklog` for token handling
- **GLib.spawn_async_with_pipes** for securely handling password prompts via `kinit`
- **St.Button**, **St.Label** for native GNOME-style UI elements
- **Promises and async operations** to keep UI non-blocking
